senomorerocketman-earlier-spaceships=Make spaceships available earlier
senomorerocketman-remove-cargo-rockets=Remove cargo rockets, launchers and landing pads
senomorerocketman-remove-delivery-canons=Remove delivery canons
senomorerocketman-earlier-logistics-system=Earlier logistics system
senomorerocketman-cheaper-satellite-launches=Cheaper satellite launches
senomorerocketman-earlier-lithium-sulfur-battery=Earlier lithium-sulfur battery
senomorerocketman-earlier-space-railway=Earlier space railways and space elevator

[mod-setting-description]
senomorerocketman-earlier-spaceships=Enable spaceships with only Rocket science and reduce ingredients to only those available on Nauvis
senomorerocketman-earlier-logistics-system=Logistics tech available with only Rocket science
senomorerocketman-cheaper-satellite-launches=Reduces the fuel usage for each stage of a satellite launch from 3 to 1 rocket items
senomorerocketman-earlier-lithium-sulfur-battery=Lithium-sulphur batteries avialable with only Production science (no Utility science)
senomorerocketman-earlier-space-railway=Space railways and elevator available with only Production and Utility science (no Energy science). Construction and maintenance of the elevator requires holmium and berylium derivatives but no additional science. Space elevator and cable require additional components to build to compensate for removal of heavy girders an heavy bearings as ingredients
