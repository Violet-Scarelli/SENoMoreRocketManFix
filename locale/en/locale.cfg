senomorerocketman-earlier-spaceships=Enable spaceships with only rocket science. Also move building personal transport capsules and refurbishment into an earlier space capsule navigation tech, and remove any ingredients not available on Nauvis from spaceship components recipies.

senomorerocketman-earlier-lithium-sulfur-battery=Lithium-sulphur batteries avialable with only Production science, not Utility science
senomorerocketman-earlier-earlier-space-railway=Space railways available with only Production science, no Energy science needed
